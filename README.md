# javaBoring
Simple maven project, MVC pattern and Javadoc documentation running slightly modified scripts from [lolPath](https://github.com/addUsername/LolPath)

To see the docs, just run /prueba/doc/index.html file

What you need:
- Windows :( but .py scripts from /prueba/src/main/resources/pys/ are almost multi, just hardcode
your paths.
- Install JDK8 and a java IDE
- Install [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) and save installation path
- This repo as a folder named prueba.
- A 1080 quality and mp4 type video, from youtube is ok.. Quality affects precision.

How make it work:
- Run your java IDE and open project, select the "prueba" folder.
- Compile and run (that green/red play button somewhere in your IDE)

How to use:
- On the first run, you should choose option "4. Crear entorno" (this will install some python libraries) 
and generating some especific .bats for your environment
- Now you are ready to go, choose "1. Leer video" or "10. Leer video faster" (min x2 faster on 180s readings
compared to option 1, much more on larger readings, x2.5 RAM also) if your hardware is good enough.


Feel free to contact if some support are requiered.
